#### Speed up your workflow
HTML-StarterKit contains everything you need to create responsive websites: Stop caring about doctypes and ubiquitous HTML parts – just start developing.

#### Modern web standards
HTML-StarterKit is based on HTML5, styled using SCSS and is completely responsive out of the box. See the [demo page](http://zitrusfrisch.com/html-starterkit/demo).

#### It's free!
HTML-StarterKit is free for both personal and commercial usage under the terms of the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). So fork away! :-)

## HTML-StarterKit contains the following files

#### index.html
HTML5 based index file with common meta tags, links to CSS- and javascript files and exemplary content.

#### styles.css / styles.min.css  
Compiled stylesheets built from SCSS files.

#### functions.js / functions.min.js
Use functions.js for your personal scripts and functions.

#### SCSS  
The scss folder contains all styles, including Normalize CSS-Reset, basic styles and placeholders for frequently used UI elements as well as media query settings for common viewports. Following a modular approach each section and module has its own scss file. HTML-StarterKit comes with a set of handsome mixins and functions ready to use.  

## Build Styles

For default, compiled css-files are placed in the `css`-directory. If you want to rebuild your styles do following steps:

### Install depencendies

`$ npm install`

### Compile Styles

`$ npm run build`
